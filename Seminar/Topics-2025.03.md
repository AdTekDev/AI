# AI Topics - 2025.03

## General Instructions
- Students will work in groups to complete this project. (2-5 students)
- Each group must choose one topic only from the options listed below.
- Topics are divided into three major categories: Tool-Based Topics, Application Domains, and Use Case Scenarios.
- Each category contains several specific topics, along with a set of uniform requirements for all topics within that category.

## TOPICs  

### Category 1: Tool-Based Topics  
**Objective**: Explore and evaluate AI-related tools and platforms.  

**Requirements**:  
1. Clearly describe the main features and functionalities of the selected tool.  
2. Analyze the advantages and limitations of the tool in practical use.  
3. Identify and explain the machine learning models integrated into the tool that are applicable to real-world problems.  
4. Demonstrate how to use the tool, specifying the types of inputs and outputs it accepts or generates.  
5. Design five different prompts for a specific scenario, use them in the tool, and critically evaluate the outcomes in terms of relevance, accuracy, and usability.
  
**Tools**:  
-   





### Category 2: Application Domains  
**Objective**: Investigate how AI tools are applied in specific professional or industrial domains.    

**Requirements**:
1. Provide an overview of the selected domain, including its core characteristics.       
2. Explain the benefits of using AI tools in various tasks or operations within the domain.  
3. Identify and describe relevant training models that can be applied in this domain using existing tools.  
4. Select three real-world scenarios within the domain, and for each, demonstrate how an AI tool can be used, including details on inputs, processing, and outputs.  
5. For one chosen scenario, create five different prompt variations, apply them using the tool, and analyze the results in terms of effectiveness and potential impact.
