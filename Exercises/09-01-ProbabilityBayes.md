### B.01.
An automobile manufacturer has three factories: A, B, and C. They produce 50%, 30%, and 20% respectively, of a specific model of car. 30% of the cars produced in factory A are white, 40% of those produced in factory B are white, and 25% produced in factory C are white.
   
If an automobile produced by the company is selected at random, find the probability that it is white.  
Given that an automobile selected at random is white, find the probability that it came from factory B.  

### B.02.
Two manufacturers supply blankets to emergency relief organizations.   
Manufacturer A supplies 3000 blankets and 4% are irregular in workmanship.   
Manufacturer B supplies 2400 blankets and 7% are found to be irregular.   
Given that a blanket is irregular, find the probability that it came from manufacturer B.   

### B.03.
It is estimated that 50% of emails are spam emails. Some software has been applied to filter these spam emails before they reach your inbox. A certain brand of software claims that it can detect 99% of spam emails, and the probability for a false positive (a non-spam email detected as spam) is 5%.  
Now if an email is detected as spam, then what is the probability that it is in fact a non-spam email?  

### B.04.  
Three persons A, B and C have applied for a job in a private company. The chance of their selections is in the ratio 1 : 2 : 4. The probabilities that A, B and C can introduce changes to improve the profits of the company are 0.8, 0.5 and 0.3, respectively. If the change does not take place, find the probability that it is due to the appointment of C.


### B.05.

In ATD' class, if a student does homework most days, the chance of passing the course is 90%. On the other hand, if a student does not do homework most days, the chance of passing the course is only 20%.  
H = event that the student did homework  
C = event that the student passed the course  
ATD claims that 80% of his students do homework on a regular basis. If a student is chosen at random from ATD' class, find the following probabilities.
P(C)  
P(H|C)  
P(C|H)
