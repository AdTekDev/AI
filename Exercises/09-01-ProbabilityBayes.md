### B.01.
An automobile manufacturer has three factories: A, B, and C. They produce 50%, 30%, and 20% respectively, of a specific model of car. 30% of the cars produced in factory A are white, 40% of those produced in factory B are white, and 25% produced in factory C are white.
   
If an automobile produced by the company is selected at random, find the probability that it is white.  
Given that an automobile selected at random is white, find the probability that it came from factory B.  

### B.02.
Two manufacturers supply blankets to emergency relief organizations.   
Manufacturer A supplies 3000 blankets and 4% are irregular in workmanship.   
Manufacturer B supplies 2400 blankets and 7% are found to be irregular.   
Given that a blanket is irregular, find the probability that it came from manufacturer B.   

### B.03.
It is estimated that 50% of emails are spam emails. Some software has been applied to filter these spam emails before they reach your inbox. A certain brand of software claims that it can detect 99% of spam emails, and the probability for a false positive (a non-spam email detected as spam) is 5%.  
Now if an email is detected as spam, then what is the probability that it is in fact a non-spam email?  

### B.04.  
Three persons A, B and C have applied for a job in a private company. The chance of their selections is in the ratio 1 : 2 : 4. The probabilities that A, B and C can introduce changes to improve the profits of the company are 0.8, 0.5 and 0.3, respectively. If the change does not take place, find the probability that it is due to the appointment of C.


### B.05.

In ATD' class, if a student does homework most days, the chance of passing the course is 90%. On the other hand, if a student does not do homework most days, the chance of passing the course is only 20%.  
H = event that the student did homework  
C = event that the student passed the course  
ATD claims that 80% of his students do homework on a regular basis. If a student is chosen at random from ATD' class, find the following probabilities.  
- P(C)  
- P(H|C)  
- P(C|H)  

### B.06.
A computer company buys its chips from three different manufacturers. Manufacturer I provides 60% of the chips and is known to produce 5% defective; Manufacturer II supplies 30% of the chips and makes 4% defective; while the rest are supplied by Manufacturer III with 3% defective chips. If a chip is chosen at random, find the following probabilities:  
- P(the chip is defective)
- P(chip is from Manufacturer II | defective)
- P(defective |chip is from manufacturer III)  

### B.07. 
At a retail store, 20% of customers use the store’s online app to assist them when shopping in the store ; 80% of store shoppers don’t use the app.  

Of those customers that use the online app while in the store, 50% are very satisfied with their purchases, 40% are moderately satisfied, and 10% are dissatisfied.  

Of those customers that do not use the online app while in the store, 30% are very satisfied with their purchases, 50% are moderately satisfied and 20% are dissatisfied.

Indicate the events by the following:  

A = shopper uses the app in the store  
N = shopper does not use the app in the store  
V = very satisfied with purchase  
M = moderately satisfied  
D = dissatisfied  

- Find P(A and D), the probability that a store customer uses the app and is dissatisfied
- Find P(A|D), the probability that a store customer uses the app if the customer is dissatisfied.

### B.08. 
In a casino in Blackpool there are two slot machines: one that pays out 10 % of the time, and one that pays out 20 % of the time. Obviously, you would like to play on the machine that pays out 20 % of the time but you do not know which of the two machines is the more generous. You thus adopt the following strategy: you assume initially that the two machines are equally likely to be the generous machine. You then select one of the two machines at random and put a coin into it. Given that you loose that first bet estimate the probability that the machine you selected is the more generous of the two machines.

### B.09.
A radar system is designed such that the probability of detecting the presence of an aircraft in its range is 98%. However if no aircraft is present in its range it still report (falsely) that an aircraft is present with a probability of 5%. At any time, the probability that an aircraft is present within the range of the radar is 7%.  
- What is the probability that no aircraft is present in the range of the radar given that an aircraft is detected?
- What is the probability that an aircraft is present in the range of the radar given that an aircraft is detected?
- What is the probability that an aircraft is present in the range of the radar given that no aircraft is detected?  

### B.10.
An aircraft emergency locator transmitter (ELT) is a device designed to transmit a signal in the case of a crash. The KonTek Manufacturing Company makes 80% of the ELTs, the Edopa Company makes 15% of them, and the InoBox Company makes the other 5%. The ELTs made by KonTek have a 4% rate of defects, the Edopa ELTs have a 6% rate of defects, and the InoBox ELTs have a 9% rate of defects (which helps to explain why InoBox has the lowest market share).  
- If an ELT is randomly selected from the general population of all ELTs, find the probability that it was made by the KonTek Manufacturing Company.  
- If a randomly selected ELT is then tested and is found to be defective, find the probability that it was made by the KonTek Manufacturing Company
