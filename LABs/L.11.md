# W11 - Zero-Sum Games 

**Lab Session Tasks:**

Students are required to implement and test their project code with the following objectives:

* **Apply the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm** in the game logic to optimize decision-making.
* **Increase the board size** for the game to support **100x100** and **1000x1000** dimensions.
* **Measure the time** taken to select each move using the Alpha-Beta algorithm, and analyze performance under different board sizes.
